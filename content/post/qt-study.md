A record for study QT, and this is my first time writing in English.

<!--more-->

Towards the end of the term, I took a project that requires GUI, and my data structures projects also need to use GUI. After search for common framework of C++ GUI, I choose QT finally.

When installing QT for the first time, msvc2017 was not checked, I try to update but failed, then I reinstalled it.

Next, follow the requirements step by step, search immediately when I don't understand. (ps. stack overflow and stack exchange is a good website.)

The project needs to encapsulate functions into dll, at first I wrote in on VS, but I found it diffiult to use on qt, so I give up it, finally I generated dll on QT. This is what I spend most of time.

Everything is easy after that.
